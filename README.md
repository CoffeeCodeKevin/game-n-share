# game-n-share

Currently in progress ( Not working )

The goal of game-n-share is to be able to track what games you're playing, what games you have played, and share the games you want others to play.

This app was made with [Next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. I made it to better understand how to use a database with an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server, then access said database from the front-end in Next.
